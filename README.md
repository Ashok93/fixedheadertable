# fixedheadertable
Fixing the header for HTML table

1) Please make sure you add two div's above your table as like a cover first. Please refer the example.html for structure.
      
2) Then call the function fixedHeaderTable($(“.outer-div”)); // passing the reference of outer div whatever is your class name

3) Use the function definition and CSS from here.

4) Bingo! All is set. :D
